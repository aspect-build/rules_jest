## Mocking of esm exports when transforming to commonjs

When transforming esm to commonjs, swc defines the exports as readonly.
This is a problem when trying to mock the exports using `jest.spyOn()`.

See https://github.com/swc-project/swc/discussions/5151

Examples similar to this workaround (making esm imports `writeable`):

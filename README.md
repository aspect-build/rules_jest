# Bazel rules for jest

Runs tests with the https://jestjs.io/ test runner under Bazel.

rules_jest is just a part of what Aspect provides:

-   _Need help?_ This ruleset has support provided by https://aspect.dev.
-   See our other Bazel rules, especially those built for rules_js, such as rules_ts for TypeScript: https://github.com/aspect-build

## Installation

From the release you wish to use:
<https://github.com/aspect-build/rules_jest/releases>
copy the WORKSPACE snippet into your `WORKSPACE` file.

## Usage

See the documentation in the [docs](docs/) folder and the example usages in the [example](example/) folder.

> Note that the example also relies on code in the `/WORKSPACE` file in the root of this repo.
